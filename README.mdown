# Common Lisp TextMate Bundle

This is a slightly enhancement to the fantastic Common Lisp Bundle, originary written by Bastien Dejean.
It supports Textmate 2, so you can code with your favourite editor and your favourite programming language :)
I can't assure the backward compatibility, so if you want a fully functional bundle for TM1, use the Bastien version.
Although TM2 is supported, from TM2 seems to have disappeared the Plugin folder, so I don't know how to install the
Bastien Flexible Words plugin. Probably you won't be able to use all the code introspection commands of the original bundle.

## Requirements

* tmux
* rlwrap
* [SBCL](http://www.sbcl.org/)
* [Growl](http://growl.info/)
* [iTerm](http://iterm.sourceforge.net/) or [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/)
* [Flexible Words TextMate Plugin](http://github.com/baskerville/Flexible-Words-TextMate)

## Manual Steps

You NEED to add these environment variable to your TM2 installation "Preferences -> Environment Variables":

* TM_TMUX : "tmux_path", for example /usr/local/bin/tmux
* TM_SBCL : "sbcl_path", for example /usr/local/bin/sbcl
* TM_RLWRAP : "rlwrap_path", for example /user/local/bin/rlwrap
	
Needed by *completionCommand* :

	ln -s ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/Common\ Lisp.tmbundle/Support/sbcl_completions ~/.sbcl_completions

The *Grab Source* command needs the *src* and *contrib* folders of the sbcl sources to be present in *~/.cl/sys*.  
The *Documentation for Word* command looks in *~/.cl/doc/[hyperspec][hys]*.  
You can add a *--local* argument to *cldoc* if *~/.cl/doc/[cltl2][cl2]* exists.

## Tips

You can't interact with your Lisp interpreter unless you start a session (Control-Command-Shift-O by default).  
A short presentation is available [here](http://www.vimeo.com/13780133).  
I've also made a lispy theme: [Coal Graal](http://github.com/baskerville/Coal-Graal.tmTheme).
